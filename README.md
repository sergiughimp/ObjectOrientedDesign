# Lecture 1: Introduction to C# Console Programming

This lecture introduces the basics of C# console applications, including printing text with Console.WriteLine(), defining and calling static methods, and working with variables (int, string, bool). It also covers string concatenation, type conversion with int.TryParse(), and reading input using Console.ReadLine(). The lecture explains the program structure: namespaces, classes, and the Main method.

## Tasks

**Task 1: Area of a Rectangle**  
Calculate the area of a rectangle using fixed values for length and width. Demonstrates the use of variables and basic arithmetic.  

**Task 2: User Input for Rectangle**  
Extend the rectangle example by taking length and width values from user input. Shows how to work with `Console.ReadLine()` and type conversion.  

**Task 3: GreetUser Function**  
A function that accepts a name and prints a personalized greeting. Useful for learning functions and string formatting.  

**Task 4: ConcatenateStrings Function**  
A function that combines two strings with a space in between and returns the result. Demonstrates string concatenation and return values.  

**Task 5: SubtractNumbers Function**  
A function that takes an integer and a float, performs subtraction, and returns a descriptive message. Introduces mixed data types and formatted output.
